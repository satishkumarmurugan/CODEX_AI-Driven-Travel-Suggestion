Sure, to incorporate the instructions about training the model in a Jupyter notebook before running the `app.py`, you can update the **Installation** and **Usage** sections of the README template. Here's how you might revise those sections:

```markdown
## Installation

Before running the web application, you need to train the machine learning model using a Jupyter Notebook. Follow the steps below to set up your environment and train your model.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

```
### Setup and Model Training

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/satishkumarmurugan/CODEX_AI-Driven-Travel-Suggestion.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd CODEX_AI-Driven-Travel-Suggestion
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook used for model training:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ID3.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model. This will involve loading your dataset, preprocessing the data, training the model, and saving the trained model along with any necessary label encoders to disk.

5. Once the model is trained and saved, proceed to run the Flask application.

## Usage

After training the model and saving it, you can start the Flask web application by following these steps:

1. Ensure you are in the project directory where `app.py` is located.

2. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. The application will start running on a local server (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000`). Open a web browser and go to the URL provided in the terminal to interact with the application.
